# Chess-game-using-SDL2
In this project, I have created a chess game in C using the SDL2 library. It comes complete with a menu, a win/loss/tie screen and timers for each player's turn. Pieces are moved by firstly clicking on said piece, and then on the square you want to move it to. The board itself is represented using an 8x8 matrix and some structures.
